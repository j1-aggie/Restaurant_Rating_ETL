# Restaurant_Rating_ETL

Group 2: Project Proposal 10/23/20

Team Members: Jeremy Jones, Reza Abasaltian, Germaine Johnson

Github Repository Link: git@github.com:j1-aggie/Restaurant_Rating_ETL.git

Datasets: Yelp and Google Maps API endpoints

What useful investigation could be done with the final database: The database could serve as a means for rating restaurants, in the future, on their aggregate ratings 
                                                                 versus separate rating systems.

Final database: Will be relational, since rating a restaurant includes several attributes: price, quality of food,
	        cleanliness, and ambience. These attributes are subjective and unique to personal taste and expectations.
